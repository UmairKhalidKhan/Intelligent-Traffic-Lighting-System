# Intelligent-Traffic-Lighting-System
An automated system that changes light times as per the traffic conditions.
This system uses pressure sensors to gauge the traffic in all incoming lanes. NOTE: This is a down to scale model. and for real implementations, neccessary requirements will be needed to suit the correct purposes. 

This project is based on the ESP32 DEV tool kit v1. 
We will be using the Arduino IDE 1.8.19. 

Item used:
ESP32 dev tool kit v1
4x Force Sensitive resistors
breadboards
jumper cables
resistors.
LEDS

edit: FSR sensors are analog devices and can only be connected with pin that are connected to one of the two ADC channels in the ESP32.
