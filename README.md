# Intelligent-Traffic-Lighting-System
An automated system that changes light times as per the traffic conditions.
This system uses pressure sensors to gauge the traffic in all incoming lanes. NOTE: This is a down to scale model. and for real implementations, neccessary requirements will be needed to suit the correct purposes. 

This project is based on the ESP32 DEV tool kit v1. 
WE will be using the Arduino IDE 1.8.19.
